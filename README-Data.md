## Data sources used in the manuscript "Poor correlation between large-scale environmental flow violations and freshwater biodiversity: implications for water resource management and water planetary boundary"

### Aquatic fish richness data
- **Data Source**: Tedesco et al.  (2017)
- **Temporal Resolution**: Temporal aggregate from data compiled from reports between 1960 and 2014
- **Spatial Resolution (extend)**: 30 arc second (3119 drainage basins; ~80% of Earth’s land)
- **Description**: Fish richness data was compiled and processed from n 1436 published papers, books, grey literature and web-based sources published between 1960 and 2014.

### Freshwater fish facets
- **Data Source**: Su et al. (2021) 
- **Temporal Resolution**: Representative of 2015 
- **Spatial Resolution (extend)**: Basin scale (2465 drainage basins)
- **Description**: Each facet indicates the change in the corresponding biodiversity component compared to the 18th century (roughly pre-industrial era). The taxonomic facets measure the occurrence of fish in a riverine system. Whereas functional facets are calculated using the morphological characteristics of each species that are linked to the feeding and locomotive functions which in turn relates to larger ecosystem functions like food web controlling and nutrition transport. On the other hand, the phylogenetic facets measure the total length of branches linking all species from the assemblage on the phylogenetic tree. The richness component of the three categories calculate the diversity among the assemblage whereas the dissimilarity accounts for the difference between each pair of fish assemblage in the same realm.

### RivFishTIME dataset
- **Data Source**: Comte et al., 2021
- **Temporal Resolution**: Variable (1951 -2019)
- **Spatial Resolution (extend)**: Stream reach (11386 sampling location) (global)
- **Description**: The database includes 11,386 time-series of riverine fish community catch data, including 646,270 species-specific abundance records together with metadata related to geographic location and sampling methodology of each time-series.

### Environmental Flow Envelope (EFE)
- **Data Source**: Virkki et al. (2022)
- **Temporal Resolution**: Monthly (Pre-industrial: 1801-1860)
- **Spatial Resolution (extend)**: Aggregated to Level 5 HydroBASIN (global)
- **Description**: The EFE framework establishes an envelope of variability constrained by discharge limits beyond which flow in the streams may not meet the freshwater biodiversity needs

### Streamflow
- **Data Source**: ISIMIP (2020)
- **Temporal Resolution**: Monthly (Pre-industrial: 1801-1860, Historical: 1976-2005)
- **Spatial Resolution (extend)**: Aggregated to Level 5 HydroBASIN (global)
- **Description**: The streamflow data was obtained from Inter-Sectoral Impact Model Intercomparison Project (ISIMIP) simulation phase 2b outputs of global daily discharge (aggregated to monthly for this study). ISIMIP is a community-driven climate-impact modelling initiative that offers a consistent framework for cross-sectoral, cross-scale modelling of the impacts of climate change. The streamflow was obtained for four Global Hydrological Models (GHM)  (H08, Lpjml, PCR-GlobWB, WaterGap2) and four Global Circulation Models (GCM) (GFDL-EMS2M, HADGEM2-es, IPSL-CM5A-lr, MICROC5) .

### Sub-basin boundaries
- **Data Source**: HydroSHEDS (Lehner and Grill, 2013)
- **Temporal Range**: NA
- **Spatial Resolution (extend)**: Level 5 HydroBASIN (global)
- **Description**: HydroBASINs are the watershed boundaries derived from the hydrographic information from HydroSHED Database, developed with a goal of providing a global coverage of hierarchically nested sub-basins at various scales. The HydroBASIN catchment offers 12 levels (level 1 - course and level 12 - detailed) of sub-basin classification globally
